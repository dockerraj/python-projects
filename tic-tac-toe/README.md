# Tic Tac Toe in Python
This is my attempt to solve the tic-tac-toe problem using python. The solution uses Python2 but imports Python3 features for portability purpose. 

This is a solution to first milestone project in Jose Portilla's course on udemy.

Some bits of it might be copied from the solution discussed by the lecturer and some bit of it is attempted on my own.
